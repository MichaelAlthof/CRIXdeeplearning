Name of Quantlet : CRIXportfolio

Published in : Deep Neural Networks for Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction

Description : 'Build three cryptocurrencies portfolios based on price movements forecasts
with MLP, RNN and LSTM neural networks in order to outperform CRIX. We apply three different weight strategies:
price, marketcap and equally weighted portfolios. We use the predictions to build quarterly rebalanced
buy and hold portfolios and also long-short portfolios. We compare the performance with the baseline models.'

Keywords : neural networks, deep learning, cryptocurrency, CRIX, portfolio, prediction, time series, stock price forecast
